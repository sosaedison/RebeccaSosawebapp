					<h2>About the Project</h2>
					<p>
		For this project, we created a single page application about air quality. To do so, we used 2 external APIs, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" >Open AQ Platform </a> and the<a href="https://docs.openaq.org/#api-_" >Open AQ Platform </a>, to
		make an interactive page to allow a user to investigate air quality from all over the world.
		This project also incorporates Vue JS as a framework to make building the app simpler.
		There is also a second page "About the Project", which will document our team, our development process, and demo the final application with some interesting findings.
