					<h2>About the Project</h2>
					<p>
		For this project, we created a single page application about air quality. To do so, we used 2 external APIs, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" > Leaflet API </a> and the <a href="https://docs.openaq.org/#api-_" >Open AQ Platform </a>, to
		make an interactive page to allow a user to investigate air quality from all over the world. It also uses <a href="nominatim.openstreetmap.org">Nominatim</a> to help search for locations by name.
		This project also incorporates Vue JS as a framework to make building the app simpler.
		There is the second page "About the Project", which documents our team, our development process, and demos the final application with some interesting findings.
